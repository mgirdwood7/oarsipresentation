##Is hip rotation strength implicated in .blue[symptomatic] and .red[structural] osteoarthritis outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament injury?

## Why the hip after ACL Reconstruction?


.pull-left[
#### What we know:
- 24% of people suffer from patellofemoral pain at 1 year post ACLR .font60[(Culvenor, 2017)]

- Hip muscle weakness is characteristic of PFJ pain and knee osteoarthritis .font60[(Rathleff, 2014)]

- Hip rotation muscles play a role in the control of knee positioning during movement .font60[(Cashman, 2012)]

]


.pull-right[
#### What we **don't** know:

- Limited research into hip rotation strength after ACLR

- Whether hip rotation strength is associated with long term knee sypmtoms

## Research Question: 

> - How does hip strength differ between the injured and non-injured side in people 1-year after ACLR?

> 

> - Is hip strength associated with functional, symptomatic and structural outcomes?

## Methods: participants

.pull-left[
- Longitudinal study monitoring knee joint structure, function and symptoms (Culvenor et al, 2015)

- Primary ACLR (HS autograft) 1 year prior 

- No structured rehab

## Methods

.center[

**Hip External Rotation & Internal Rotation with HHD**

Measured *only at 1 year* with hand held dynamometer according to Kemp et al 2013, JSAMS protocol

## Methods: Outcomes and Analysis


.red[Structural Outcomes]

.pull-left[
**Osteoarthritis** - measured on x-ray with OARSI criteria .font60[(Altman, 2007)]
- joint space narrowing of grade ≥ 2
- sum of osteophytes ≥ 2
- grade 1 osteophyte in combination with grade 1 joint space narrowing 
]

.pull-right[

**Cartilage worsening** - measured on MRI with MRI OA Knee Score (MOAKS) semiquantitative evaluation on VISTA sequence.

Worsening of cartilage lesions at 5 years was defined as an increase in the score in any corresponding subregions for that compartment (i.e. increase in previous defect severity, or new feature identified in same compartment). .font60[(Runhaar et al., 2014)]

### Results: Injured vs non-injured side

.left-column[.black[#### Controlling for gender:

Small but significant difference in ER strength

SMD = -0.33 (-0.6 to -0.07)]

<br></br>

.black[No difference in IR strength.]]

.right-column[<img src= "affnonaff.png" width = "85%" />]

## Association to .blue[Symptoms]

- .font90[**Higher** hip ER & IR strength was associated with **superior** AKPS  at 1 and 5 years.]

.center[<img src = "ameplot.png" width = "107%"/>]

---

## Assocation to .red[Structure] (Imaging)

.pull-left[
- Lower hip ER strength was associated with **worsening tibio-femoral** cartilage lesion score **.black[at 5 years]**  

  - Odds Ratio: 0.01 (95%CI 0.00 to 0.41)

- No other significant relationships identified
]

.pull-right[<img src = "kneemri.png" width = "80%" /> ]

---
## Assocation to .red[Structure] (Imaging)

No relationship between hip rotation strength and worsening patellofemoral carti- lage scores or patellofemoral osteoarthritis

<img src = "or_forest.png" width = "80%" />

---

## Discussion

- Hip ER may influence symptomatic and structural outcomes as it is critical to single leg functional tasks.

- ER specific weakness could result from:

  -  lack of training/rehab

  - weakness broadly of the entire lower limb (not specific to the hip).

## Key Summary

.content-box[
- Hip ER strength was impaired on the injured side at 1 year post ACLR

- This may contribute to .blue[symptomatic], and .red[structural] outcomes up to 5 years post-operatively.

- Contrary to initial hypothesis, hip rotation strength was not associated with PFJ structure
