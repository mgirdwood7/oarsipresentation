## Hip rotation strength after anterior cruciate ligament injury: relationship to functional, symptomatic and structural outcomes

## Why the hip after ACL Reconstruction?


.pull-left[
#### What we know:
- 24% of people suffer from patellofemoral pain at 1 year post ACLR .font60[(Culvenor, 2017)]

- Hip muscle weakness is characteristic of PFJ pain and knee osteoarthritis .font60[(Rathleff, 2014)]

- Hip rotation muscles play a role in the control of knee positioning during movement .font60[(Cashman, 2012)]

]


.pull-right[
#### What we **don't** know:

- Limited research into hip rotation strength after ACLR

- Whether hip rotation strength is associated with long term knee sypmtoms

## Research Question: 

> - How does hip strength differ between the injured and non-injured side in people 1-year after ACLR?

> 

> - Is hip strength associated with functional, symptomatic and structural outcomes?

---

## Methods: participants

.pull-left[
- Longitudinal study monitoring knee joint structure, function and symptoms (Culvenor et al, 2015)

- Primary ACLR (HS autograft) 1 year prior 

- No structured rehab

### Results: Injured vs non-injured side

.left-column[.black[#### Controlling for gender:

Small but significant difference in ER strength

SMD = -0.33 (-0.6 to -0.07)]

<br></br>

.black[No difference in IR strength.]]

## Assocation to .green[Function]

- Both Hip ER and IR were associated with all  measures at 1 year and 5 years.

- Strongest relationships with <u>Hop for Distance</u> and <u>Triple Crossover Hop</u> for both.

- Adjusted R<sup>2</sup> values were lower at 5 years:

| .purple[1 Year] | ER | IR | 
|-|---|---|
|Hop for distance| 0.51| 0.47
| One leg rise | 0.24 | 0.21|
| Side Hop | 0.5 | 0.34 |
| Triple Hop | 0.6 | 0.59 |
]

| .green[5 Year] | ER | IR | 
|-|---|---|
|Hop for distance| 0.4| 0.33
| One leg rise | 0.22 | 0.15|
| Side Hop | 0.42 | 0.31 |
| Triple Hop | 0.46 | 0.38 |

## Association to .blue[Symptoms]

- .font90[**Higher** hip ER & IR strength was associated with **superior** AKPS  at 1 and 5 years.]

## Assocation to .red[Structure] (Imaging)

.pull-left[
- Lower hip ER strength was associated with **worsening tibio-femoral** cartilage lesion score **.black[at 5 years]**  

  - Odds Ratio: 0.01 (95%CI 0.00 to 0.41)

- No other significant relationships identified

## Discussion

- Hip ER may influence symptomatic and structural outcomes as it is critical to single leg functional tasks.

- ER specific weakness could result from:

  -  lack of training/rehab

  - weakness broadly of the entire lower limb (not specific to the hip).

## Key Summary

.content-box[
- Hip ER strength was impaired on the injured side at 1 year post ACLR

- This may contribute to functional, symptomatic, and structural outcomes up to 5 years post-operatively.

- Contrary to initial hypothesis, hip rotation strength was not associated with PFJ structure
